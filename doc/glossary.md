By alphabetic order:

- **Dual variable**: output of a linear optimisation problem, indicating how "costly" it is to satisfy a given 
constraint. In the case of supply-demand equilibrium constraint (at a given time-slot t), the interpretation is the 
following: how costly would it be to satisfy a supplementary unit of demand at this time 

- **PV**: PhotoVoltaic

- **VRE**: Variable Renewable Energy (sources)

- **RES** : Renewable Energy Sources - including hydro., wind, PV solar

- **Residual demand**: demand - sum of fatal (non-controllable) production (e.g., from RES)
