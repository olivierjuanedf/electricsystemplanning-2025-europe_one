* **PyPSA** documentation: https://docs.pypsa.org/v0.35.1/. Be sure to **LOOK AT THE DOC OF VERSION 0.35.1** (the one 
used in this code environment) and not version 1.0 (which has just been released)
-> this online doc **can be used for Practical session 2**, with the 1-zone Unit Commitment toy model (to understand 
the main commands to create an electricity system in PyPSA framework)
-> **normally not really useful for Practical session 3** as the connection with PyPSA framework is already done 
in the code you will be playing with

* **ERAA** (European Resource Adequacy Assessment) documentation (2023.2 will be used): https://www.entsoe.eu/outlooks/eraa/ -> to get **some information about the collection, preparation and limitations of data**.
    - (i) **ERAA is a dataset** yearly collected, "built" and made available by ENTSO-E, but also a long-term planning model (and study) to assess... European Resource Adequacy! 
    - (ii) **Only an extract of these data is available here**: 2 "Target Years" (2025, 2033) over the 4 ones provided in ERAA2023.2 edition, 6 climatic years over 35 ones available (1982-2016 historical period).

* ACER (EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators) **"Electricity country sheets"** https://energiaoltre.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-Retail-Monitoring-Report-Country-Sheets-Electricity.pdf
-> provide some main figures about the different EU countries in terms of electricity consumption (and other metrics)

even if other countries data are provided (will less details)
